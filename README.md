Inlcudes:

Tranzit
  - Tranzit-Richtofen-EE-Two-EMPs (https://github.com/yaboi-zombies/Tranzit-Richtofen-EE-Two-EMPs): 
    * Changes the final step of the easter egg to only require two lamp posts to be EMPed
  - Tranzit-Maxis-EE-Solo, by CCDeroga (https://github.com/CCDeroga/Tranzit-Maxis-EE-Solo):
    * While EMPing the Avogadro under the tower, only one turbine needs to be placed by the nav card table (some have reported issues with this step, if that's the case consider using my minor edit to CCDeroga's mod https://github.com/yaboi-zombies/Tranzit-Maxis-EE-Solo-Tweak)
    * Final step requires only one turbine underneath a lamp post
  - Tranzit-EE-Lightning-Always-at-Cornfield (https://github.com/yaboi-zombies/Tranzit-EE-Lightning-Always-at-Cornfield):
    * Stops the thunderstorm from rotating so that it is always present over the cornfield (does not change when the Avogadro will spawn, but prevents the player from having to wait for the lightning to be overhead before ending each round while waiting for the Avogadro to spawn)
  - NavTables-Always-Built (https://github.com/yaboi-zombies/NavTables-Always-Built):
    * Builds the nav card table for you if not already assembled
    
Die Rise
  - (Solo Maxis) Die-Rise-Maxis-Solo-yaboi-Edit (https://github.com/yaboi-zombies/Die-Rise-Maxis-Solo-yaboi-Edit):
    * Any elevator symbol will complete the elevator symbol step
    * Number of symbols for the dragon symbol step will scale with the number of players, and does not reset when the wrong symbol is stepped on. Note that there is a correct order to step on the symbols (meaning in solo only one of the four symbols will light up when stepped on)
    * During the orb step any player may pick up the orbs. Trample steams need to be placed at one of the pairs of lion symbols so that the orbs would fling between the two trample steams. You will know you have placed the trample steam in a valid spot when you cannot pick it back up. Note: Don't worry if there is no "steam" coming from the trample steam when placed. If it is locked in place, you're fine. After placing a pair of trample steams on opposite lion symbols correctly you will be able to place an orb on each trample steam (if you have picked one up from the lion statues). Place one orb on each trample steam of the pair. Although the trample steam may not animate, you will be able to see the orb flying between the trample steams once placed

Buried
  - (Solo Maxis) Buried-Maxis-EE-Solo by CCDeroga (https://github.com/CCDeroga/Buried-Maxis-EE-Solo)
    * Wisp cant disappear during wisp step and does not need to pass through zombies
    * Bell step doesn't have a timer anymore and will only reset if you fail. Bells must be completed one at a time
    * Sharpshooter autocompletes
  - (Solo Richtofen) Buried Easter Egg QOL V1.0 by Nathan3197 (https://gitlab.com/Nathan3197/stick-gaming-pluto-t6zm-dlc4-ee-patch/-/tree/main)
